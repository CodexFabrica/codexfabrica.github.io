One of the most frequent questions we receive is: *Why Markdown?*

At CodexFabrica, we've made the deliberate choice to standardize our writing tools—starting with **Feder**—around Markdown. We believe it is the only format that truly respects the user's focus and the longevity of their data.

### The Power of Simplicity
Markdown is readable by humans and machines alike. Unlike compiled formats or proprietary binary files, Markdown is plain text. This ensures that the documents you write today will be accessible decades from now, regardless of the software you use.

### Bridging the Gap
While LaTeX offers unparalleled precision, it comes with a steep learning curve. Markdown bridges the gap, offering enough structure for technical documentation while remaining fast enough for creative brainstorming.

Our mission at CodexFabrica is to keep refining the Markdown experience, adding the premium feeling of a modern IDE to the simplicity of a text file.

Join us as we redefine technical writing, one line of Markdown at a time.
